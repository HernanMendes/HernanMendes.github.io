# Portfolio
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. It includes a collection of HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript files that make up the site, as well as all of the images, videos, and other media that I use. To create this portfolio, I was inspired by the following freeCodeCamp tutorial: [Create a Portfolio Website Using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript/).

The code is publicly available under an MIT license, so others are free to use and adapt it for their own purposes.

Thank you for considering my portfolio website! I hope you find it helpful and informative.
